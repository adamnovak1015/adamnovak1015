<p align'left'>Hi! Iâ€™m Adam, a Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) graduate with a background in teaching and a passion for using data to make smarter decisions. After diving into the world of business analysis through my certificate program at TripleTen, Iâ€™m now focused on applying my skills to solve real-world problems with data-driven insights. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Tableau, Power Bi, spreadsheets, data cleaning and transformation, and SQL.

During my learning journey, I completed projects to help sharpen my skills in each of the above categories. You can learn more about these projects in my repsoitories. With my experience in the classroom, Iâ€™ve honed the kind of skills that don't always show up in spreadsheets, such as critical thinking, collaboration, engaging both like-minded and different-minded people, and an eye for the small details that make a big difference.

Some facts about me:
- I enjoy participating in professional events and professional development. If you're not growing, you're stagnant!
- I love spending time with my wife and two dogs, and time spent outside is especially refreshing to me.
- I am a musician, I can play five instruments proficiently and multiple others at an intermediate level.
- Dream vacation: a trip to Japan.
- My goals for this next season: land my dream job in Business Analytics!
